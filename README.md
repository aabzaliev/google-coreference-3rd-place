# google-coreference-3rd-place
[WIP] I'm still cleaning and composing some stuff together

This repository contains the code for the [gap-coreference challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/gendered-pronoun-resolution/leaderboard), hosted by kaggle.
Very brief description is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/gendered-pronoun-resolution/discussion/90424#latest-523376). The extensive description will be given in a techincal report later.

The data is not included. In order to reproduce the solution, you have to have the following files in your gap/data directory:
1. Development, val and test sets from [gap-coreference](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/gap-coreference)
2. ConLL formatted ontonotes (can be obtained from [here](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19))
3. [Winogender](https://github.com/rudinger/winogender-schemas)
4. [Winobias](https://github.com/uclanlp/corefBias)
5. [DPR](https://github.com/decompositional-semantics-initiative/DNC/raw/master/inference_is_everything.zip)
